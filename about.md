Hi! I'm Aryn! 

* I'm a Mechanical Engineering Student at the Indiana Institute of Technology.
* My cad software of choice is OnShape, although I'm capable with Inventor and NX as well. 
* My 3D Printer is an Anycubic i3 Mega, her name is Mini and I love her with all my heart. 
* I'm an FIRST Robotics Competition alumna and volunteer with FLL, FTC, and FRC.

Other than that, there's nothing too notable coming to mind, if you have any questions or just want to talk, feel free to send me an email. Thanks!
